# VkMaterialSystem

This is a project to try out building a generic(ish) material system for Vulkan. Currently it only supports loading a single material (defined in json) onto a full screen quad.

Most of the actual material loading logic and data types (which is the whole point of this project) is found in material_loading.cpp, and asset_rdata_types.h.
